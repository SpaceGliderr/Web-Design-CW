DIIT - Web Design CW 2020

To all students of Miss Mohana visiting this repository,

First of all, I'd like to give a big thanks to Miss Mohana for featuring my assignment, and to you guys for taking interest. Now a few things to note from looking at my assignment: 
1. Please note that the code structure and filing system is quite messy, so excuse me on that. Maybe one day I'll open a pull request to fix it.
2. When reading the code, also excuse its messiness, it was fueled by multiple coding sessions involving a bunch of coffee in the middle of the night till the wee hours of the morning.
3. Do not copy the work, take inspiration. While some of you may just want a free pass, just know that you aren't doing yourself any good by pressing Ctrl + C, Ctrl + V all the time.

Anyways, happy coding and all the best to all of you in getting your Diploma certificates.

Sincerely,
Nick.
